  <title>Ontologies and The Internet of Things</title>
  
  <content>
    <p>
    We are witnessing a new revolution in computing and
    communication. The Internet, which has spanned several networks in
    a wide variety of domains, is having a significant impact on every
    aspect of our lives. The next generation of networks will utilize
    a wide variety of resources with significant sensing
    capabilities. Such networks will extend beyond physically linked
    computers to include multimodal information from biological,
    cognitive, semantic, and social networks. This paradigm shift will
    involve symbiotic networks of people, intelligent devices, and
    mobile personal computing and communication devices (mPCDs), which
    will form net-centric societies or smart networked systems and
    societies (SNSS). mPCDs are already equipped with a myriad of
    sensors, with regular updates of additional sensing
    capabilities. Additionally, we are witnessing the emergence of
    "intelligent devices," such as smart meters, smart cars, etc.,
    with considerable sensing and networking capabilities. Hence,
    these devices---and the network---will be constantly sensing,
    monitoring, and interpreting the environment---this is sometimes
    referred to as the Internet of Things. And as local and wide area
    networks became almost secondary to the WWW (World-Wide Web),
    users and their usage patterns will become increasingly
    visible. This will have significant implications for both the
    market for advanced computing and communication infrastructure and
    the future markets---for nearly 4.5 billion people---that
    net-centric societies will create.

    Well-designed and constructed net-centric societies will result in
    better quality of life, reduced threat from external sources, and
    improved commerce. For example, assume a scenario where people at
    various locations suffer from flu-like symptoms. In a net-centric
    society, mPCDs will send vital signs and other associated
    information to appropriate laboratories and medical centers. These
    centers will analyze the information, including searching the
    Internet for potential solutions, and will aid in determining
    possible causes for this phenomenon. Based on the diagnosis,
    people will be directed to the nearest clinic for treatment. Here
    we have several types of information flowing through the net: data
    from mPCDs; location information; images; video; audio; etc..

    Ontologies will play a significant role in the realization of
    SNSS. For example, a considerable amount of data passes through
    the network and should be converted into higher abstractions that
    can be used in appropriate reasoning. This requires the
    development of standard terminologies which capture objects and
    events. Creating and testing such terminologies will aid in
    effective recognition and reaction in a network-centric situation
    awareness environment. This would involve identifying a
    methodology for development of terminologies for multimodal data
    (or ontologies), developing appropriate ontologies, developing
    testing methods for these ontologies, demonstrating
    interoperability for selected domains (e.g., healthcare,
    situational awareness), and using these ontologies in decision
    making.

    <p>The purpose of this year's <strong><a
    href="http://ontolog.cim3.net/OntologySummit/">Ontology Summit</a></strong>
    is to explicate such applications of ontologies to the challenges
    and promises of The Internet of Things.</p>
