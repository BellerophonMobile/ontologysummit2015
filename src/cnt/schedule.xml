Dr. Chris Greer, who is in charge of the NIST's CPS program in unable to come as he has a conflict with the CPS week. He is going to ask his deputy, Dave Wollman, if he can address us.

I am yet to hear from Lynne Canavan, Senior Program Manager for the Industrial Internet Consortium. I hope to meet her next week to discuss this.
I have not contacted anyone from DARPA. I can contact Bill Regli, Deputy Division Director  in the Defense Sciences Office to check his availability if you want me to.
